<h1>Basics</h1>

When creating the language, I tried to make it as light and compact as possible. <br>
Don’t know if it worked out, but the basics of the language are really simple.

<h2>Alphabet</h2>

<div class="notation">
    A B C D E G H I L M <br>
    N O P R S T U W Y
</div>

The crawler alphabet has 19 letters, capital letters do not exist at all. <br>
You can see their spelling to the right of the text.

<h2>Pronunciation</h2>

<div class="notation">
    ?[as'] ![vɒu] ;[ɲj]
</div>

All letters have a single sound, which is pronounced when reading. <br>
Some signs have their own name and also must be pronounced in speech. <br><br>

<div class="notation">
    th[ð] ph[θ] sh[ʂ] ch[t͡ɕ] <br>
</div>

The only exception is that some letter combinations form their own sound. <br>
To avoid this, if needed, you can put the sign ' between them.

<h1>Word Formation</h1>

<div class="notation">
    PrefixRoot`Ending
</div>

It's simple, there are roots, prefixes and endings, the last two are needed to change the meaning of the word. <br>
Prefixes are at the beginning, roots are in the middle, and endings that are separated from the root with the sign `
<br>
For now, there are only a few endings and prefixes, which are listed below.
