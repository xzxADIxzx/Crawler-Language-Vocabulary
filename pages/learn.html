<h1>Basics</h1>

When creating the language, I tried to make it as light and compact as possible. <br>
Don’t know if it worked out, but the basics of the language are really simple.

<h2>Alphabet</h2>

<div class="notation" translate="no">
    A B C D E G H I L M <br>
    N O P R S T U W Y
</div>

The crawler alphabet has 19 letters, capital letters do not exist at all. <br>
You can see their spelling to the right of the text.

<h2>Pronunciation</h2>

<div class="notation" translate="no">
    ?[as'] ![vɒu] ;[ɲj]
</div>

All letters have a single sound, which is pronounced when reading. <br>
Some signs have their own name and also must be pronounced in speech. <br><br>

<div class="notation" translate="no">
    th[ð] ph[θ] sh[ʂ] ch[t͡ɕ]
</div>

The only exception is that some letter combinations form their own sound. <br>
To avoid this, if needed, you can put the sign ' between them.

<h1>Word Formation</h1>

<div class="notation" translate="no">
    PrefixRoot`Ending
</div>

It's simple, there are roots, prefixes and endings, the last two are needed to change the meaning of the word. <br>
Prefixes are at the beginning, roots are in the middle, and endings that are separated from the root with the sign `
<br>
For now, there are only a few endings and prefixes, which are listed below.

<h2>Endings</h2>

<div class="notation">
    oco - vision <br>
    oco`i - to see
</div>
<div class="box">
    <div>
        i - verb, noun
    </div>
    <div>
        Denotes that the word is a verb, but can also mean a noun. <br>
        Explanation: to observe, observation.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="notation">
    soma`i - to sleep <br>
    soma`in - to wake up
</div>
<div class="box">
    <div>
        in - noun
    </div>
    <div>
        Also denotes that the word is a verb, but indicates a completed action.
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Prefixes</h2>

<div class="notation">
    mawo - wetness <br>
    lamawo - wet
</div>
<div class="box">
    <div>
        la - adjective, participle
    </div>
    <div>
        Denotes that the word is an adjective.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="notation">
    lasouwl - slow <br>
    thasouwl - slowed
</div>
<div class="box">
    <div>
        tha - adjective, participle
    </div>
    <div>
        Denotes that the word is an adjective, but indicates that this property is forced on the object.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="notation" style="font-size: 30px">
    lamow`i - one who moves by himself <br>
    namow`i - one who moves someone
</div>
<div class="box">
    <div>
        na - participle
    </div>
    <div>
        Denotes that the subject gives some property to the object.
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Adjectives and participles</h2>

Adjectives are formed using the prefixes la and tha, the latter means that the characteristic was given forcibly. <br>
Participles are formed using the prefix na, meaning that the subject gives some characteristic to the object. <br><br>

<div class="notation">
    lawuic bumo crawler <br>
    lahoni dohil soma
</div>

If a sequence of adjectives comes before the word to which they refers, then the prefix la is placed only before the
first one, for reasons of space. However, you can do it and it will not be considered a mistake. <br>
Remark: if there is a sequence of words with different prefixes, then they must all be written down so as not to lose
information.

<h1>Sentence formation</h1>

<div class="notation">
    owl dot? - what am I doing? <br>
    owl do drim`i niw - I am sleeping.
</div>

All sentences consist of a subject and subordinate parts, acting as a predicate, adjective or object. <br>
Subordinate parts are separated from the subject by the question they answer. <br>
Explanation: the example on the right uses the conjunction dot, which denotes an action.

<h2>Conjunctions and the questions they answer</h2>

<div class="notation">
    yoy dot? - what are you doing? <br>
    owl dot oco`i - I am watching.
</div>
<div class="box">
    <div>
        dot - what the subject does
    </div>
    <div>
        What the subject is doing at the moment, or at all if no time is specified.
        Since this is the most commonly used conjunction, it can be shortened to <i>do</i> if followed by a consonant.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="notation">
    yoy co? - who are you? <br>
    oco`i co yoy - I see you.
</div>
<div class="box">
    <div>
        co - who is the subject, on whom the subject performs an action
    </div>
    <div>
        Can mean who, which or whom. To minimize confusion, another conjunction was introduced.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="notation">
    oco`i coho? - who do I/you see? <br>
    mord`in co, coho? - who killed whom?
</div>
<div class="box">
    <div>
        coho - on whom the subject performs an action
    </div>
    <div>
        On whom the subject is performing, has performed or will perform an action. <br>
        Used when there may be confusion between who and whom.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="notation">
    mord`in cuth? - why did I/you kill? <br>
    soma`i cuth neybl - I sleep because the night.
</div>
<div class="box">
    <div>
        cuth - reason for an action
    </div>
    <div>
        The reason why the subject does, did or will do the action. <br>
        Do not confuse with ima. Here we are talking about the cause, not the goal.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="notation">
    owl arch human - I am human. <br>
    owl arch lawol - I am alive. <br>
    tou pi tou arch nin - two plus two equals four. <br>
    dom`i arch phuil - used as fuel.
</div>
<div class="box">
    <div>
        arch - what is it, what it looks like or equals to, and what it is used as
    </div>
    <div>
        What the subject is or what qualities it has, what it is equal to or what subject it is used as. <br>
        It's easy to get confused among all these values, so I hope the examples will help you figure it out.
